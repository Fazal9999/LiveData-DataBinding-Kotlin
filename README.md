# LiveData-DataBinding-Kotlin

As you may know Google introduced support for LiveData with Data Binding in [Android Studio 3.1 Canary 6](https://androidstudio.googleblog.com/2017/12/android-studio-31-canary-6-is-now.html).

## Project Goal

Learn to use LiveData + Databinding 

## Setup Android Studio 3.1.2


``` 

buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.2'
    }
}

```

## LiveData + Data Binding

" You can now use a LiveData object as an observable field in data binding expressions. The ViewDataBinding class now includes a new setLifecycle method that you need to use to use to observe LiveData objects "

--------------------------
Feel free to report or add any useful feature, I will be glad to improve it with your help.


Code style
--------------------------

This project is written on [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and uses [ktlint](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint).
If you find that one of your pull reviews does not pass the CI server check due to a code style conflict, you can
easily fix it by running: `./gradlew ktlintFormat`, or running IntelliJ/Android Studio's code formatter.
